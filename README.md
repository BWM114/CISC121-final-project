### Algorithm Selection Reason
I chose the Bubble Sort algorithm because:
- **Simple and easy to understand:** The algorithm logic is intuitive, suitable for beginners to understand the sorting principle.
- **Good visualization:** Each comparison and swap step is clearly displayed.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking 
### 1. Decomposition
- Decompose the sorting problem into multiple array traversals
- Each traversal is decomposed into multiple comparisons of adjacent elements
- Determine whether to perform a swap operation based on the comparison results
### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Repeatedly compare two adjacent elements
- Larger elements will gradually "float" to the correct position on the right like bubbles
- After each traversal, the current largest element will move to the final position
### 3. Abstraction
- **Showing to the user**: The current state of the array, displaying the compared elements, and the swapping process
- **Hidden implementation details**: Index calculation, loop control variables, and other low-level details
#### 4. Algorithm Design
- Input → Parse the input → Execute the bubble sort algorithm → Visualize the process → Output the result
